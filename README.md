# Keyboard PCB Guide <!-- omit in toc -->

## Introduction <!-- omit in toc -->

Frustrated from the lack of documentation available on the internet, I decided to make my own keyboard PCB making guide with updated resources. The main tutorial aims to teach how to make an ARM keyboard PCB using KiCad to those who are new to PCB design. Aside from the main tutorial, there will also be guides on other components of a keyboard PCB such as USB-C, TRRS conectors, backlighting, RGB, etc.

- The whole tutorial will be migrated to Notion. I will also be updating it in the coming weeks and hopefully be able to finish it. [Notion link here](https://www.notion.so/Peioris-Boards-8286e5c43ad449a3bff70127d2f2dbbb)
